# Chelonii

The Chelonii robot is a fully open-source physical-expermiental platform intended for the study of mobile robots control, artificial vision, navigation and machine learning. It is an effort to build a affordable platform for the students in the "Control of mobile robots" course to build their own low-cost platform that allows them to continue experiment and learning outside the campus.

# Main characteristics
- The Chelonii robot has a morphology of a differential robot. 
- The robot is intended to be used with the Robot Operating System [(ROS2)](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html) runing in an embedded system such as Raspberyy Pi.
- The low-level controller could be any Arduino-like board such as the STM32 Nucleo-f401re
- The cad files of the system are completely open-source using the [FreeCad](https://www.freecadweb.org/) format
- An URDF descriptor is also available<br>

# Demo
- **This project is still at an early stage and efforts are being made on the mechanical design.**
- **Some major changes will be made between the original mechanical structure and the current model.**
